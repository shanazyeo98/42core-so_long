# 42core so_long

## Overview
so_long is a 2d game project implemented in C which uses MinilibX graphics library for rendering.  The main purpose of the game is to navigate the character to collect all the collectibles and make it to the end point.

In this implementation, I took inspiration from Jujutsu Kaisen.

## Concepts
1. MinilibX library
